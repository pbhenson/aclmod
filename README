Introduction
------------

aclmod is a utility to manipulate DFS ACLs. It's basically a replacement
for chmod in the DFS environment that supports extended ACL syntax and
permissions, as well as wildcards and recursion.

aclmod syntax is almost a strict superset of chmod, and allows you to
change ACL entries quickly and powerfully. You can make absolute changes
or relative changes to entries, and you can delete the current entries
before assigning the new ACL. I think a few examples will best
illustrate the flexibility of aclmod:

     aclmod go+rx *.dat
     -- Adds read/execute permission to the group_obj, other_obj, and
        any_other entries on all files that match the wildcard.

     aclmod -R u:fred=rwx dir
     -- Recursively adds the entry user:fred with read/write/execute
        permissions on dir and all files/directories contained within
        it.

     aclmod -d -O ugo=rw,O=r file
     -- Deletes any existing entries, and then assigns read/write
        permission to user_obj, group_obj, and other_obj, and read
        permission to any_other


Installation
------------

There are two prerequisites for using aclmod. First, you must have perl
5.003 or greater available on your system. Second, you must have both
DCE-Perl and DFS-Perl installed. (Actually, I suppose having a DCE cell,
and a DFS filesystem that supports ACLs, is also a prerequisite, but
we'll assume you've already taken care of that ;). This version of
aclmod requires at least DCE-Perl version 0.17 and DFS-Perl version
0.25 (later versions will most likely work as well).


DCE-Perl is available via CPAN, or via github:

	https://github.com/pbhenson/DCE-Perl


DFS-Perl is available via CPAN, or via github:

	https://github.com/pbhenson/DFS-Perl


Once you have installed perl, DCE-Perl, and DFS-Perl, the only other
configuration you might need to do is edit the first line of aclmod.
It defaults to using /usr/local/bin/perl. If perl is not installed in
that location, you need to edit the first line of aclmod to point to
where perl is installed at your site.

Copy aclmod to where ever you'd like it to be, and make sure that it
has the correct permissions for users to run it. Installation is now
complete.

A future version of aclmod will include more documentation, such as a
man page. For now, you can run 'aclmod -h' to get a short summary of
aclmod usage.
